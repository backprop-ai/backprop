    "\n",
    "Zero-shot classification is a relatively simple idea.\n",
    "As with standard classification, a model looks at input and assigns probabilities to a set of labels.\n",
    "However, with zero-shot, the model was not trained on any particular set of labels.\n",
    "This makes the classifier extremely flexible for a variety of use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backprop supports this in 100+ languages ([docs](https://backprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))."

It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements.[9] The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is suited for testing the spacecraft systems and equipment required for possible future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.\"\"\"\n",

I make chili so often that not making it when everything is on hand feels like a betrayal of the muscle memory I’ve built up over many tomato-splattered years.\n",

    "But as much as I adore a spicy bowl of chili, there are nights when I’d rather have soup. Especially when I’ve got a bright, vegetable-focused soup on my mind, one that’s filled with white beans and winter greens, spiked with ginger and red-pepper flakes, and rounded out with only a little ground turkey.\"\"\"\n",
