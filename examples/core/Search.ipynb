    "\n",
    "## Why use it with Kiri?\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you'd like to host the Docker instance remotely, AWS has a small free-tier instance. It has 750 monthly hours, so you can leave it constantly running.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Local only\n",
    "Refer to [this guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html) to get Elasticsearch running locally on your computer.\n",

    "Once you've got it installed and running, it's easy to use with Kiri.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elastic-specific Kiri classes\n",
    "Kiri includes variants of its Document and DocStore classes (ElasticDocument and ElasticDocStore).\n",
    "These variants handle the necessary procsesing to turn a Document object into an Elastic-ready one,\n",
    "as well as back into an object when retrieved *from* Elasticsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this makes it incredibly easy to switch from a dev environment with `InMemorySearch` and standard `Documents` to an Elastic one ready for production."
