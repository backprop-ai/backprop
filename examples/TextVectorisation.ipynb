    "Everything inside a model is numbers. Say a model has to classify text. The way it does that is process the text to build an internal representation of it. This is then used to compute probabilities for available categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way, every natural language model does text vectorisation. It is just not visible as output. This task is all about using models which have been explicitly trained to predict and output vectors."

    "\n",
    "Once you have at least two vectors you can compare them. A common approach is to use cosine similarity, which calculates a value between -1 and 1. Our models have been trained to have cosine similarities mostly between 0 and 1, which makes it easy to score how similar a piece of text is to another.\n",
