Utils
=====

Functions from ``backprop.utils`` are used for model inference, finetuning, saving, loading and uploading.

This page covers saving, loading and uploading. See the full reference in :ref:`backprop-utils`.

Save
----

It is recommended to save a model via a task instead (i.e ``task.save()``)

.. automodule:: backprop.utils.save
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :noindex:


Load
----

.. automodule:: backprop.utils.load
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :noindex:


Upload
------

It is recommended to upload a model via a task instead (i.e ``task.upload()``)

For a successful upload, ensure that the model is valid by following the check list in :ref:`models`.

.. automodule:: backprop.utils.upload
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
   :noindex:
